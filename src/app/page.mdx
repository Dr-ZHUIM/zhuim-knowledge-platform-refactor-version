# Dr.Zhuim's knowledge platform

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my knowledge platform, here you may find out my demos, snippets or expriences of workflow.

## :rocket: Let's see what can be a demo!

This platform is based on Mdx and Remark libs which means every demo should consist of a .tsx file and a .mdx file.

Such as the demonstration below :

A typical Count demo of React

<br />

Here's React-part code:

```js
import $Mdx from "./home.mdx";
import FadeIN from "@/components/FadeIn/FadeIn";
import { useState } from "react";

function CountDemo() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((v) => v + 1)}>count++</button>
      <span style={{ marginLeft: "25px" }}>{count}</span>
    </div>
  );
}

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <section>
      <FadeIN
        children={
          <$Mdx
            components={{
              CountDemo,
            }}
          />
        }
      />
    </section>
  );
}
```

And Here's the Mdx-part code until this line:
